# Resistance Calculation

> For Transistor, resistance looking into $Source = \dfrac{1}{g_m + g_{mb}}, Drain = r_o, Gate = \infty$

> To calculate resistance looking into a circuit:

- **GND all independent Sources**

# Norton/Thevenin's Theorem

> Any linear two-terminal network can be represented by a Thévenin equivalent (**voltage source in series with a resistance**) or a Norton equivalent (**current source in parallel with a resistance**).
