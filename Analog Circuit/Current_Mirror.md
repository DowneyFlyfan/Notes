# Basic Current Mirrors

> Track to get mirror current

- Mirror Chain can't be too long

> Sizing Issues: $W_{eff} \neq W, L_{eff} = L - 2 L_{Diff}$

- Use more transistors (series or parallel) to copy $2I_{REF}, \dfrac{1}{2} I_{REF}$

# Cascode Current Mirrors

> To solve the problem of unqeual $V_{DS}$ in basic current mirror

- 1st Approach: cascode 2 mirrors (less voltage headroom, $V_{th}$ less)

- 2nd Approach: in order to solve the voltage headroom problem, we need to create $V_b$ in another way
